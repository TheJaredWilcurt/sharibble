#Sharibble

Sharibble is an anonymous chat website that allows users to post links to photos and videos and have them instantly visible to everyone in the chatroom.

Previously Sharibble was being developed under the codename [FullFrontalPaging](https://github.com/nmhai3/FullFrontalPaging).

Sharibble was originally created using Meteor as it's framework, however we are transitioning it to Angular at this time.
